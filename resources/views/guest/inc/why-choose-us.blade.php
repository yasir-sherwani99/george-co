                    At our organization, we view "Excellence" not only as achieving the highest level of
                    performance in our work but also as upholding the highest ethical standards in all
                    aspects of our operations. Our Business Principles guide our actions and we must never
                    deviate from them, regardless of the challenges we may face. Our pursuit of Excellence
                    relies on earning and maintaining the trust of our customers, employees, local
                    communities, and colleagues, by consistently demonstrating that we are deserving of
                    their confidence. We acknowledge that any unethical behavior by an employee could
                    potentially jeopardize the reputation and integrity of the entire organization.
                    Therefore, every employee is empowered and accountable for maintaining a culture of
                    ethical excellence. In all our decisions, we ask ourselves the fundamental question,
                    "Are we doing the right thing in the right way?"
